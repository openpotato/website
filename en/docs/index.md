# About Us

OpenPotato is the home of our Open Data projects. Here, you will also find Open Source tools for data exchange and data generation.

By *us*, we mean [STÃœBER SYSTEMS GmbH](https://www.stueber.de). ðŸ˜Š

The name *OpenPotato* is a satirical nod to the somewhat derogatory German term *Kartoffelcloud*, which is a synonym for a nationally focused interpretation of digital sovereignty.
