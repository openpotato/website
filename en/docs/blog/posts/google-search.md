# How To Use Google Search Effectively

Google search is our everyday companion when looking for information on the web. The user interface is quite simple: you type in your search term, and most of the time, you're bombarded with an almost endless list of search results. Often, what you're actually looking for can be found on page 2 or 3, or not at all.

You can, however, *google* very effectively by using search operators. In this blog article, I'll introduce you to search operators that will help you refine your Google searches and achieve much more accurate results.

## Basic Search Operators

Let's start with basic operators that allow you to logically combine multiple terms.

### Quotation Marks

Quotation marks enable you to search for an exact phrase. This is particularly useful when searching for a specific quote or a fixed combination of words.

Example: `"To be or not to be"`

### Logical OR

These operators allow you to search for one of several options. Use OR or the pipe symbol (|) to include alternative terms.

Examples: `Apple OR Google` or `Apple | Google`

### Logical AND

The AND operator (implicitly included in every Google search) ensures that all specified terms are included in the results.

Example: `Apple AND iPhone`

### Logical Parentheses

Parentheses allow you to set the priority for complex searches, similar to mathematics.

Example: `(cat OR dog) AND (food OR toy)`

### Exclusion

The minus sign allows you to exclude certain terms from the search results.

Example: `cheese -cake`

### Wildcard

The asterisk acts as a placeholder for an unknown or any word.

Example: `"the best * 2024"`

## Specific Search Operators

Now, let's look at the more interesting operators.

### site:

This operator allows you to restrict your search to a specific website or domain.

Example: `"Moon landing" site:esa.int`

### filetype: and ext:

These commands allow you to search for specific file types.

Examples: `school holidays 2023/2024 filetype:pdf` or `school holidays 2023/2024 ext:doc`

### cache:

This operator lets you view the cached version of a webpage stored by Google.

Example: `cache:wikipedia.org`

### related:

This operator helps you find websites that are thematically similar to a specific website.

Example: `related:esa.int`

### intitle: and allintitle:

With *intitle:*, you can search for pages where a specific word appears in the title. With *allintitle:*, you can search for pages where all specified words appear in the title.

Examples: `intitle:"Open Data"` or `allintitle:"Open Data" "Open Source"`

### intext: and allintext:

With *intext:*, you search for pages where the content contains a specific word. With *allintext:*, you search for pages where all specified words appear in the text.

Examples: `intext:"Open Data"` or `allintext:"Open Data" "Open Source"`

### inurl: and allinurl:

These operators allow you to search for pages where the URL contains specific words.

Examples: `inurl:opendata` or `allinurl:open data`

### before: and after:

These operators allow you to restrict your search to a specific publication period.

Examples: `artificial intelligence before:2023` or `artificial intelligence after:2023`

### source:

This operator is useful when you want to find news from a specific source.

Example: `artificial intelligence source:bbc.com`

### define:

This operator gives you a definition of the specified term.

Example: `define:Open Data`

### weather:

With this operator, you get the current weather forecast for a specific location.

Example: `weather:Berlin`

### map:

This operator shows you a map from Google Maps of a specific place.

Example: `map:Berlin`

### movie:

With this operator, you can search for movie information.

Example: `movie:2001: A Space Odyssey`

### stocks:

For those who need it: This operator allows you to search for current stock prices.

Example: `stocks:AAPL`

## Conversions

Google can do a bit of maths too.

### Units

You can use the `in` operator to convert back and forth between units. An unit converter always appears.

Example: `20km in mm`

You can also simply search for `unit converter`, in which case the unit converter will also appear.

### Colours

By simply entering a colour code, it can easily be converted into another colour code:

You can convert colour codes from:

+ Hex
+ RGB
+ Pantone

Examples: 

+ `rgb(255, 255, 255)`
+ `rgb 255 255 255 255`
+ `#f0f0f0`
+ `colour f0f0f0`
+ `pantone 214 u`
+ `pms 200 c`

A colour picker always appears, which displays the following colour systems:

+ Hex
+ RGB
+ HSV
+ HSL
+ CMYK

You can also simply search for `color picker` and the colour picker will also appear.

## Why is it called *googling*?

The verb *googling* is derived from the product name Google. The name Google itself is based on the English term *Googol*, a word coined by American mathematician Edward Kasner for the number 10<sup>100</sup>. That's a 1 followed by 100 zeros.

## Conclusion

By skillfully using Google operators, you can significantly improve your search results and find more precise information. Try it out in your next search.

Oh, and a little Google fun to wrap things up:

1. Open Google search and look for "cat".
2. Click on the animated paw print icon.
3. Now, click around on the Google webpage.
4. Yes, I agree, it's useless! üêæ
